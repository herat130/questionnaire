Coding Challenge Questionnaire
Create a small questionnaire Web Application similar to what Typeform.com offers https://www.typeform.com/#home-examples
Concepts:
- Questionnaire
- A Questionnaire has a title and a description
- A questionnaire has a defined sequence of question that need to be answered
- Question
- 3 different types of questions are supported: Freetext, Multiple choice (single answer), Multiple
choice (multi answer)
- For Multiple Choice, each choice has a descriptive label that is shown to the user

Requirements:
- As a user I can answers questions very swiftly so that I don’t feel like I am wasting my time
- Your questionnaire is based on a JSON that the frontend uses to drive the questions
- As a user I can go back to a previous question without losing the answers I have given in a current question
- Mobile First, use some SVG, use JS ES 6-7 features, good conventions for CSS

Task:
- Write a small web application that enables a user to answer a questionnaire
- Use the given questionnaire.json to derive the definition of a questionnaire
- Use a modern client side MVC Framework like Ember (highly preferred), GlimmerVM (bleeding edge), or
react (although we prefer emberJ)
Goals/Priorities
• Show UX skills, use CSS and possibly animate the transition between questions (high priority)
• At least 1 component test (not auto generated) (high priority)
• Clean code and MVC based application structure (high priority)
• There is no need to store results in a database
• Bonus: The design is responsive

General remarks
Please provide the code through a private Github or Bitbucket repository. If you don’t have an account to a repo we can provide one. Please keep track of the time you spent on the tasks.
